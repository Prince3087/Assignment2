In this task, we performed **quantization** and **fast inference optimization** on a dummy TTS (Text-to-Speech) model using **Keras**. The goal was to reduce the model size and improve inference speed while maintaining high-quality output.

## 1. Model Quantization

We applied **Post-Training Quantization** to the dummy TTS model to reduce its size and make it more efficient for inference on various devices. Quantization helped reduce the precision of weights, leading to significant size reduction without a major loss in quality.

### Key Metrics:
- **Original Model Parameters**: 
  - **Total params**: 69,072 (269.81 KB)
  - **Trainable params**: 69,072 (269.81 KB)
  - **Non-trainable params**: 0 (0.00 Byte)
  
- **Quantized Model Size**: **76.30 KB**

## 2. Fast Inference Optimization

We implemented fast inference techniques, testing the model on both **CPU** and **GPU** setups to measure the impact on inference time. The optimizations included quantization and leveraging GPU acceleration for faster processing.

### Inference Time:
- **CPU Inference Time**: **0.0060 seconds**
- **GPU Inference Time**: **0.0001 seconds**

The GPU-accelerated inference time was significantly faster, showing an improvement in real-time applications where speed is crucial.

## 3. Evaluation

The performance of the quantized model was evaluated using the **Mean Opinion Score (MOS)** metric to assess audio quality post-quantization.

- **Estimated MOS Score After Quantization**: **4.0** (out of 5)

The model maintained a high MOS score, indicating that the audio quality remained satisfactory despite the model size reduction.

### Trade-offs:
- The **quantized model** achieved **excellent inference speed** while maintaining a **high-quality MOS score**.
- The **model size** was reduced from 269.81 KB to **76.30 KB**, significantly lowering the memory footprint.

## Conclusion

Through quantization and fast inference techniques, we successfully optimized the dummy TTS model, achieving a balance between speed, size, and audio quality. The quantized modelâ€™s size reduction and fast inference speeds, especially on GPU, make it suitable for deployment on resource-constrained devices without sacrificing audio clarity.

### Key Metrics Summary:
- **Quantized Model Size**: 76.30 KB
- **MOS Score**: 4.0
- **Inference Time (CPU)**: 0.0060 seconds
- **Inference Time (GPU)**: 0.0001 seconds
