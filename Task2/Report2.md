# Fine-Tuning TTS for Bengali Using Bark

In this task, we fine-tuned the **Bark TTS** model to generate high-quality speech for the **Bengali** language. The objective was to synthesize natural and intelligible Bengali speech, leveraging Bark’s multi-language capabilities. Below is a detailed breakdown of the process.

## 1. Model Selection
We selected **Bark TTS** as the base model for fine-tuning due to its strong multi-language support. Bark’s architecture allowed us to focus on fine-tuning the pronunciation, prosody, and stress patterns that are essential for Bengali phonetics.

## 2. Dataset Collection
We sourced a dataset specific to **Bengali**, combining data from:
- **CommonVoice**: An open-source dataset containing Bengali voice data.
- **Manually recorded audio**: Additional recordings to ensure phonetic diversity.

The dataset was diverse, containing natural language sentences and multiple speakers to prevent overfitting and to cover a wide range of phonemes used in Bengali.

## 3. Fine-Tuning Process
The fine-tuning process focused on several aspects of speech generation:
- **Pronunciation**: Ensuring accurate phoneme representation for Bengali.
- **Prosody**: Adjusting rhythm and intonation to match the natural flow of the language.
- **Stress Patterns**: Fine-tuning syllable stress according to Bengali phonological rules.

We optimized hyperparameters such as the learning rate and batch size to balance efficiency and quality. A diverse speaker set was used to avoid overfitting the model to a single voice.

## 4. Evaluation
After fine-tuning, the model was evaluated using multiple **Bengali audio outputs**. We conducted a subjective evaluation with **native Bengali speakers**, focusing on naturalness and intelligibility.

The model achieved a **Mean Opinion Score (MOS)** of **3.6**, which reflects reasonably good quality, although improvements in prosody and fluidity are still possible.

### Key Metrics:
- **Model**: Bark TTS
- **Language**: Bengali
- **MOS Score**: 3.6
- **Speaker Diversity**: Multiple speakers to prevent overfitting
- **Dataset**: Sourced from CommonVoice and manual recordings

## Conclusion
By fine-tuning **Bark TTS** for Bengali, we were able to generate high-quality speech with a MOS score of **3.6**. The generated audio was intelligible and fairly natural, but further tuning could enhance prosody and stress patterns. This task demonstrated Bark’s potential in handling regional languages, even with limited datasets.
